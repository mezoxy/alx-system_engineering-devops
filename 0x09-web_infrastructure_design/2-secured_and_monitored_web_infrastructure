    1-Explanation of some components and terms used in this infrastructure

Firewalls: Protect web servers from unauthorized access by acting as intermediaries between internal and external networks, blocking undesired incoming traffic.

SSL Certificates: Encrypt traffic between web servers and external networks to thwart man-in-the-middle attacks, ensuring privacy, integrity, and identification.

Monitoring Clients: Analyze server performance, assess health, and alert administrators to issues. Provide key metrics, test server accessibility, measure response time, and identify errors, including security vulnerabilities.

    2- The issues with this infrastructure

SSL Termination: Terminating SSL at the load balancer leaves traffic between the load balancer and web servers unencrypted.

Single MySQL Server: Poses scalability issues and acts as a potential single point of failure for the web infrastructure.

Uniform Server Components: Servers with identical components lead to resource contention (CPU, Memory, I/O), causing poor performance and scalability challenges.
